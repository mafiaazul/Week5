 * Write a program that reads a number between 1,000 and 999,999 from the user,

 * Here is a sample dialog; the user input is in color:
 * 
 * Please enter an integer between 1,000 and 999,999: 23,456
 * 23456

 * Hint: Read the input as a string. Measure the length of the string. Suppose it contains n characters. 
 * Then extract substrings consisting of the first n â€“ 4 characters and the last three characters.
